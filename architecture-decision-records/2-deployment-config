# ADR-2: Deploy with AWS Lightsail and monolithic setup

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025/10/20

## Context

This is my first time ever deploying a full-stack application to production. I'm on a limited budget (5-10 USD/month max). I want to balance my learning experience,  cost-effectiveness and complexity of the deployment. I want my project to be publicly accessible for demonstration purposes to potential employers and friends.

As also pointed out in the readme, the application consists of:

- Sails.js REST API (Node.js)
- React SPA frontend
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis session store

Alternatives considered include:

- PaaS provider (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Render): simplifies deployment too much, limits infrastructure learning.
- AWS Lightsail single instance (API + frontend + DB + Redis): fixed monthly cost, simpler setup, decent AWS services exposure.
- EC2 single instance (API + frontend + DB + Redis): more flexible, but requires more management and has variable costs.
- EC2 (API + frontend) + managed services (RDS + ElastiCache): mimics real productions systems better, but higher cost and complexity.
Serverless architectures were disregarded due to overall high complexity.

## Decision

Deploy the entire application stack on a single AWS Lightsail instance + Route 53 for DNS due to low cost, simplicity, and sufficient learning opportunity. Later, I can migrate to EC2 and/or managed services if needed.

## Consequences

### Positive

- I showcase basic DevOps competence.
- I gain hands-on experience with AWS services and cloud deployment.
- I don't run into unpredictable billing issues.
- Simpler to manage and maintain.

### Negative

- Limited scalability (not likely an issue).
- Limited performance due to limited resources of Lightsail instance.
- Single point of failure (high availability is not a major concern).
